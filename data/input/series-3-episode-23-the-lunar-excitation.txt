				<p><em>Scene: On the roof of the apartment building.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, we&#8217;ve got power to the laser.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I should&#8217;ve brought an umbrella.</p>
<p>Leonard: What for? It&#8217;s not going to rain.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.</p>
<p>Howard: That&#8217;s a bazinga, right?</p>
<p>Sheldon: One of my best, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>Leonard: Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.</p>
<p>Howard: You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don&#8217;t have to peep through windows.</p>
<p>Raj: It&#8217;s not like that, I&#8217;m watching someone&#8217;s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey&#8217;s Anatomy.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?</p>
<p>Leonard: Relax, it&#8217;s just a dirty sock.</p>
<p>Sheldon: How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?</p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Not my world.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, you know who&#8217;d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I wasn&#8217;t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.</p>
<p>Raj: Why don&#8217;t you ask her to come up?</p>
<p>Leonard: I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s still a little weird since, you know&#8230;</p>
<p>Howard: She dumped you?</p>
<p>Leonard: She didn&#8217;t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, it&#8217;s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don&#8217;t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.</p>
<p>Leonard: Screw you guys. I&#8217;m gonna go see if she&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Howard: If it&#8217;s not too much trouble, I&#8217;d like to point this at the moon now.</p>
<p>Raj: Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something&#8217;s very wrong.</p>
<p><em>Credits sequence.</em></p>
<p><em>Scene: Penny’s door.</em></p>
<p>Penny: Oh, hi. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>Leonard: We&#8217;re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.</p>
<p>Penny: I&#8217;m sorry, what?</p>
<p>Leonard: It&#8217;s pretty cool. We&#8217;ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.</p>
<p>Man in Penny’s Apartment: That makes no sense.</p>
<p>Penny: Um&#8230;</p>
<p>Man: How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There&#8217;s no gravity.</p>
<p>Penny: Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.</p>
<p>Zack: Hey.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, sorry, I didn&#8217;t know you were busy. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p>Zack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, but what about the party?</p>
<p>Zack: It&#8217;s a surprise party, doesn&#8217;t matter when we get there.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, right.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how&#8217;d you two guys meet?</p>
<p>Zack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.</p>
<p>Leonard: Your company?</p>
<p>Zack: Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, menus.</p>
<p>Zack: I know it sounds easy but there&#8217;s a lot of science that goes in designing them.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The roof.</em></p>
<p>Howard: Happy now? I&#8217;m moving the dirty sock.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.</p>
<p>Penny: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.</p>
<p>Zack: Hey.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hello.</p>
<p>Zack: Whoa! Is that the laser? It&#8217;s bitchin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin&#8217;.</p>
<p>Zack: Well, mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Leonard: Let me explain what we&#8217;re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we&#8217;re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh! That&#8217;s very cool.</p>
<p>Zack: One question. How can you be sure it won&#8217;t blow up?</p>
<p>Leonard: The laser?</p>
<p>Zack: The moon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: See, now this is a man for Penny.</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, that&#8217;s a great question, Zack.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Penny: Sheldon! Play nice.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well it&#8217;s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we&#8217;re going to blow up the moon? That&#8217;s a great question.</p>
<p>Leonard: Don&#8217;t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.</p>
<p>Zack: Smart.</p>
<p>Leonard: Now, we&#8217;ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won&#8217;t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.</p>
<p>Zack: Naked.</p>
<p>Leonard: Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.</p>
<p>Zack: Cool, it&#8217;s gonna be in 3-D?</p>
<p>Howard: Preparing to fire laser at the moon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Make it so.</p>
<p>Howard: There it is. There&#8217;s the spike!</p>
<p>Leonard: 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That&#8217;s the moon! We hit the moon!</p>
<p>Zack: That&#8217;s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.</p>
<p>Zack: What species is that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I was wrong. Penny can do better.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, guys, thank you, it&#8217;s been fun.</p>
<p>Zack: Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?</p>
<p>Penny: No, just keep walking.</p>
<p>Sheldon: He must be very skilled at coitus.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. </em></p>
<p>Raj: I&#8217;m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.</p>
<p>Howard: Horse.</p>
<p>Raj: What?</p>
<p>Howard: The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.</p>
<p>Raj: That&#8217;s disgusting, dude.</p>
<p>Howard: No, it&#8217;s not&#8230; Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, thanks.</p>
<p>Howard: You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.</p>
<p>Leonard: Have they found a match for you?</p>
<p>Howard: Tons. I&#8217;ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I can&#8217;t bring the nitrogen tank down.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why not?</p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, let me restate that. It&#8217;s very heavy, and I don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;ll help you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.</p>
<p>Raj: You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Raj: No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein&#8217;s monster was lonely and he found a wife.</p>
<p>Howard: He didn&#8217;t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, we&#8217;ll call that plan B.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Coming!</p>
<p>Penny: Damn you, you rat bastard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Are you drunk?</p>
<p>Penny: Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!</p>
<p>Leonard: How did I ruin him?</p>
<p>Penny: &#8216;Cause in the olden days, I never would&#8217;ve known he was so stupid.</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on, he wasn&#8217;t that stupid.</p>
<p>Penny: Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, yeah, he&#8217;s stupid.</p>
<p>Penny: He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.</p>
<p>Leonard: How is that my fault?</p>
<p>Penny: You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.</p>
<p>Leonard: Where are we going?</p>
<p>Penny: We&#8217;re gonna have sex.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why? I mean, okay.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<p>Penny: Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s gonna get loud.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh! Not this again.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The next morning.</em></p>
<p>Sheldon: In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.</p>
<p>Penny: What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?</p>
<p>Sheldon: When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I&#8217;m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, thanks, I&#8217;m not hungry.</p>
<p>Sheldon: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, sorry about that.</p>
<p>Sheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I&#8217;ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, God.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, God. That I&#8217;ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: How many times have I asked you not to do that?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Counting this instance? 317.</p>
<p>Leonard: Where&#8217;s Penny?</p>
<p>Sheldon: She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.</p>
<p>Leonard: I wonder why she didn&#8217;t say good-bye.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?</p>
<p>Leonard: I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I have no difficulty believing you&#8217;re not butter.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Penny’s door.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, I&#8217;ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.</p>
<p>Leonard: Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, yeah, tonight&#8217;s not great for me.</p>
<p>Leonard: Doesn&#8217;t have to be tonight. I&#8217;m free pretty much always.</p>
<p>Penny: Leonard, last night was a mistake.</p>
<p>Leonard: When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?</p>
<p>Penny: Look, I&#8217;m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?</p>
<p>Leonard: No, it&#8217;s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, God!</p>
<p>Leonard: So, that&#8217;s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?</p>
<p>Penny: Look, I said I&#8217;m sorry. Can&#8217;t u please let it go?</p>
<p>Leonard: How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.</p>
<p>Mrs Gunderson: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. </em></p>
<p>Raj: Holy crap.</p>
<p>Howard: What?</p>
<p>Raj: We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.</p>
<p>Howard: Excuse me?</p>
<p>Raj: The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.</p>
<p>Howard: You&#8217;re kidding. An actual woman?</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.</p>
<p>Howard: Trust me, breasts doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean woman.</p>
<p>Raj: Since when?</p>
<p>Howard: I&#8217;ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.</p>
<p>Leonard: Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?</p>
<p>Raj: Do you know what he&#8217;s talking about?</p>
<p>Howard: Nope. Why don&#8217;t you ask him?</p>
<p>Raj: Leonard, what are you talking about?</p>
<p>Leonard: I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Raj: That was a lousy suggestion.</p>
<p>Howard: Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Scene: A building corridor.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. <em>(Knocks on door) </em>I can&#8217;t do it.</p>
<p>Leslie Winkle: Hello?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.</p>
<p>Leslie: Leonard Hofstadter. What&#8217;re you doing here?</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, I know! It&#8217;s been a while!</p>
<p>Leslie: Yeah, 18 months.</p>
<p>Leonard: Right. Right. So how you doing?</p>
<p>Leslie: Fine. You?</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn&#8217;t mean anything, it was just for fun?</p>
<p>Leslie: Yeah.</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?</p>
<p>Leslie: What happened? Blondie dumped you?</p>
<p>Leonard: She didn&#8217;t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.</p>
<p>Leslie: Right.</p>
<p>Leonard: Um, anyway, apparently, it&#8217;s okay to go back to people you&#8217;re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.</p>
<p>Leslie: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, what do you say?</p>
<p>Leslie: Let me think about it. <em>(Slams door.)</em></p>
<p>Leonard: She&#8217;s not coming back.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. </em></p>
<p>Raj: Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.</p>
<p>Howard: Not us. Him.</p>
<p>Raj: Yes, but him doesn&#8217;t even know about her.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, him about to find out about her.</p>
<p>Raj: Really? Us gonna tell him?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Who&#8217;s going to tell whom about what?</p>
<p>Howard: Sheldon. Hey.</p>
<p>Raj: Hi.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Your surprise confuses me. I live here.</p>
<p>Howard: Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Be more specific.</p>
<p>Howard: Four thirty.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That&#8217;s not afternoon. That&#8217;s preevning.</p>
<p>Howard: What?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It&#8217;s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I&#8217;m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.</p>
<p>Raj: Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, tomorrow&#8217;s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I&#8217;ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.</p>
<p>Raj: But it&#8217;s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.</p>
<p>Howard: And that&#8217;s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating&#8221;</p>
<p>Raj: Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, come on, where&#8217;s your scientific curiosity?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it&#8217;s wondering why I&#8217;m having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.</p>
<p>Sheldon: He didn&#8217;t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, well, why don&#8217;t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don&#8217;t drink coffee.</p>
<p>Howard: All right, you can have a hot chocolate.</p>
<p>Sheldon: As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.</p>
<p>Howard: Why?</p>
<p>Sheldon: What&#8217;s life without whimsy?</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, I&#8217;m out.</p>
<p>Raj: Sheldon, I&#8217;ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You&#8217;re bluffing.</p>
<p>Raj: Are you willing to risk it?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Curse you.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Thirty feet.</p>
<p>Penny: Oh. Hey, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!</p>
<p>Penny: Are you drunk?</p>
<p>Leonard: Come on. We&#8217;re gonna have sex, and it&#8217;s not gonna mean a thing!</p>
<p>Penny: Are you out of your mind?!</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m really starting to think there&#8217;s a double standard here.</p>
<p><em>Scene: A coffee shop.</em></p>
<p>Sheldon: In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?</p>
<p>Raj: You don&#8217;t know we&#8217;re wrong yet.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Haughty derision it is.</p>
<p>Amy: Excuse me. I&#8217;m Amy Farrah Fowler. You&#8217;re Sheldon Cooper.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I&#8217;m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I&#8217;m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.</p>
<p>Amy: If that was slang, I&#8217;m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I&#8217;m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.</p>
<p>Amy: I don&#8217;t object to the concept of a deity, but I&#8217;m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.</p>
<p>Amy: Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.</p>
<p>Sheldon: May I buy you a beverage?</p>
<p>Amy: Tepid water, please.</p>
<p>Howard: Good God, what have we done?</p>
