				<p><em>Scene: The comic book store.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Sheldon: Smell that? That&#8217;s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!</p>
<p>Howard: They&#8217;re on me today, boys.</p>
<p>Raj: You&#8217;re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?</p>
<p>Howard: No, I&#8217;m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.</p>
<p>Raj: Oh, get over yourself, it’s a high-tech toilet.</p>
<p>Leonard: Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go</p>
<p>where no man has gone before.</p>
<p>Howard: Is that supposed to be funny?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I&#8217;m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.</p>
<p>Raj: He&#8217;s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.</p>
<p>Stuart: Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It&#8217;s mind-blowing.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Excuse me, spoiler alert.</p>
<p>Stuart: I didn&#8217;t spoil anything.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You told me it&#8217;s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.</p>
<p>Stuart: I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Said the Grinch to Christmas.</p>
<p>Stuart: Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, sure, what&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>Stuart: Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, vaguely.</p>
<p>Raj: Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.</p>
<p>Leonard: What about it?</p>
<p>Stuart: Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn&#8217;t go that well.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.</p>
<p>Stuart: I can&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why the hell not?</p>
<p>Stuart: &#8216;Cause we&#8217;re going out again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?</p>
<p>Stuart: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.</p>
<p>Stuart: Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don&#8217;t want to screw it up.</p>
<p>Leonard: Nobody wants that.</p>
<p>Stuart: So, here&#8217;s my question. It&#8217;s the second date, you think she&#8217;ll be expecting things to get physical?</p>
<p>Leonard: Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?</p>
<p>Stuart: Okay, so, you&#8217;ll give me a call?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, or you call me.</p>
<p>Stuart: Great.</p>
<p>Leonard: Or nobody calls anyone.</p>
<p>Raj: Interesting. Penny&#8217;s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.</p>
<p>Leonard: You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m listening.</p>
<p>Howard: Just tell him to do everything you&#8217;ve done with her for the last two years.</p>
<p><em>Credits sequence.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Scene: The lobby.</em></p>
<p>Penny: Hey, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, hi.</p>
<p>Penny: How&#8217;s it going?</p>
<p>Leonard: Good, good. You?</p>
<p>Penny: Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?</p>
<p>Leonard: Sure.</p>
<p>Penny: You know your friend Stuart?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.</p>
<p>Leonard: About what?</p>
<p>Penny: Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? &#8216;Cause you know, you and me&#8230;</p>
<p>Leonard: No, no that&#8217;s the past. I&#8217;m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, &#8217;cause, well, that&#8217;s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn&#8217;t bother me.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, well, that&#8217;s really cool of you.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, well I wouldn&#8217;t say cool, I&#8217;d just say, that&#8217;s Leonard!</p>
<p>Penny: Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?</p>
<p>Leonard: About Stuart? Love to.</p>
<p>Penny: He’s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, uh, first of all, don&#8217;t underestimate the value of discomfort.</p>
<p>Penny: Really?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that&#8217;s why he works in a comic book store.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The university cafeteria. Leonard’s phone rings. </em></p>
<p>Leonard: Oh. It&#8217;s Stuart.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You&#8217;re not going to answer it?</p>
<p>Leonard: He wants to talk about Penny. I don&#8217;t want to talk about Penny.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You&#8217;re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.</p>
<p>Leonard: Why would he call me?</p>
<p>Sheldon: We don&#8217;t know. And if you don&#8217;t answer the phone, we can&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m not answering the phone, Sheldon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Answer the phone, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: No! There, it went to voice mail.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Aren&#8217;t you going to check your messages?</p>
<p>Leonard: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.</p>
<p>Leonard: It must be hell inside your head.</p>
<p>Sheldon: At times.</p>
<p>Howard: Guys, we have a code red.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?</p>
<p>Howard: Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.</p>
<p>Leonard: How teeny tiny?</p>
<p>Howard: It&#8217;s gonna fail after about ten flushes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: But the mission is for six months.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, see, that&#8217;s the code red. It&#8217;s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Have you notified NASA?</p>
<p>Howard: No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there&#8217;s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, what are you gonna do?</p>
<p>Howard: I&#8217;m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I&#8217;ll tell them.</p>
<p>Leonard: So, what do you need us for?</p>
<p>Raj: He can&#8217;t figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.</p>
<p>Raj: I&#8217;m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I agree. It&#8217;s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment.</em></p>
<p>Howard: All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Raj: Don&#8217;t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?</p>
<p>Leonard: Good one.</p>
<p>Raj: Yeah.</p>
<p>Howard: Yeah, ha, it&#8217;s hilarious. Now, here&#8217;s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.</p>
<p>Raj: You mean so it doesn&#8217;t hit the fan?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. <em>(There is a knock on the door)</em></p>
<p>Stuart: Hey Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey Stuart.</p>
<p>Stuart: You busy?</p>
<p>Leonard: Um&#8230;</p>
<p>Howard: Classified, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, it&#8217;s a regular Manhattan Project. What&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>Stuart: Well, tonight&#8217;s my date with Penny and since we haven&#8217;t been able to connect by phone&#8230;</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s been broken.</p>
<p>Stuart: Or e-mail.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, that too. Everything&#8217;s broken.</p>
<p>Stuart: Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.</p>
<p>Leonard: All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.</p>
<p>Stuart: Okay.</p>
<p>Leonard: You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don&#8217;t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.</p>
<p>Stuart: Fear?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, like, you&#8217;re afraid that if you touch her, she&#8217;ll break.</p>
<p>Stuart: Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>Leonard: Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.</p>
<p>Stuart: Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?</p>
<p>Howard: You don&#8217;t know what this is?</p>
<p>Stuart: No.</p>
<p>Howard: Good. Get out.</p>
<p>Raj: Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.</p>
<p>Leonard: It wasn&#8217;t bad advice. It just wasn&#8217;t particularly helpful.</p>
<p>Sheldon: For what it&#8217;s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Later.</em></p>
<p>Sheldon: All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?</p>
<p>Howard: No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.</p>
<p>Leonard: I feel terrible.</p>
<p>Howard: Maybe if you were helping, you&#8217;d feel better about yourself.</p>
<p>Leonard: I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart&#8217;s date with Penny.</p>
<p>Raj: Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You don&#8217;t really believe in that superstition, do you?</p>
<p>Raj: It&#8217;s not superstition. It&#8217;s practically Newtonian. For every action, there&#8217;s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It&#8217;s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.</p>
<p>Howard: Speaking of what goes around comes around&#8230;</p>
<p>Raj: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It won&#8217;t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.</p>
<p>Raj: What if we reposition the collection tank?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It won&#8217;t work. No way to mount it.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, here&#8217;s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?</p>
<p>Sheldon: That could work.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Outside Penny’s door. Leonard knocks, Penny answers in her dressing gown.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Morning.</p>
<p>Penny: Morning. What&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>Leonard: Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity&#8230; pasta maker. I&#8217;m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.</p>
<p>Leonard: Great. So how&#8217;d it go with Stuart last night?</p>
<p>Penny: I really don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and&#8230;</p>
<p>Penny: I said I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay&#8230; I just&#8230; I kind of&#8230;</p>
<p>Penny: Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?</p>
<p>Raj: If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin&#8217; latte.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. </em></p>
<p>Howard: Hang on, I think I&#8217;ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You&#8217;re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you&#8217;re building.</p>
<p>Howard: Sheldon, I know what I&#8217;m doing.</p>
<p>Sheldon: If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn&#8217;t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.</p>
<p>Raj: Howard, wait. Why don&#8217;t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?</p>
<p>Howard: Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.</p>
<p>Raj: That what that&#8217;s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.</p>
<p>Howard: Where are you going?</p>
<p>Leonard: Comic book store.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.</p>
<p>Raj: Me, too.</p>
<p>Howard: Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Why does Leonard get to go?</p>
<p>Leonard: &#8216;Cause he&#8217;s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I&#8217;m going to kick him in his ovaries.</p>
<p>Leonard: Thanks for understanding, Howard.</p>
<p>Howard: I got your back, sister. All right, I think we&#8217;ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.</p>
<p>Raj: Wow, that&#8217;s heavy.</p>
<p>Howard: Damn right it&#8217;s heavy, it&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s meat loaf, it&#8217;s been testing toilets for generations.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master&#8217;s degree.</p>
<p>Howard: Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. <em>(Switches flush. Meatloaf hits ceiling.)</em></p>
<p>Sheldon: Fascinating.</p>
<p>Raj: What do you think the problem is?</p>
<p>Howard: Not enough bread crumbs.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The comic book store.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p>Stuart: Sure, what&#8217;s up?</p>
<p>Leonard: I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.</p>
<p>Stuart: No, your advice was great.</p>
<p>Leonard: It was?</p>
<p>Stuart: Yeah, going slow really worked.</p>
<p>Leonard: You&#8217;re kidding. Never worked for me.</p>
<p>Stuart: Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.</p>
<p>Leonard: Wine? I didn&#8217;t say to give her wine.</p>
<p>Stuart: It doesn&#8217;t matter, that&#8217;s where it all went to hell.</p>
<p>Leonard: During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.</p>
<p>Stuart: No, everything was good and really hot, and I said &#8220;Oh, Penny,&#8221; and right where she was supposed to say, &#8220;Oh, Stuart,&#8221; she said&#8230; your name.</p>
<p>Leonard: Leonard?</p>
<p>Stuart: That is your name, right?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I&#8217;m sorry. That must&#8217;ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Stuart: Well, it beats you know I&#8217;m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.</p>
<p>Leonard: No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I&#8217;m sorry it didn&#8217;t work out.</p>
<p>Stuart: Not your fault.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah, how about that? See you soon.</p>
<p>Stuart: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Howard: Yes, sir, I understand classified. We&#8217;ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.</p>
<p>Penny: What&#8217;s classified?</p>
<p>Leonard: Howard&#8217;s space toilet. I&#8217;ll tell you later.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, they&#8217;ve deployed our solution. Let&#8217;s just all hope it works.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don&#8217;t see why I have to worry. My career&#8217;s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It&#8217;s funny, because it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>Penny: Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m sorry, were you talking to me?</p>
<p>Penny: Yeah, I said Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes, you did, didn&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Penny: What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Howard: Meatloaf.</p>
<p>Leonard: What was it doing on the ceiling?</p>
<p>Howard: That&#8217;s classified.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The International Space Station.</em></p>
<p>Voice: Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We&#8217;d like to make an unscheduled space walk.</p>
<p>Houston: ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?</p>
<p>ISS voice: Houston, we&#8217;d all like to step outside for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Houston: ISS, I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t authorize that.</p>
<p>ISS voice: Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door.</p>
