				<p><em>Scene: The comic book store.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: It&#8217;s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don&#8217;t know. If we&#8217;re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I&#8217;ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?</p>
<p>Leonard: What did you have in mind?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I&#8217;d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.</p>
<p>Leonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fair enough. It&#8217;d give you the right to rule a replica of England.</p>
<p>Leonard: Well, they don&#8217;t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There&#8217;s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?</p>
<p>Leonard: Just Bilbo Baggins&#8217; sword over there.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit&#8217;s dagger; wouldn&#8217;t we look silly? Okay, let&#8217;s go for it.</p>
<p>Stuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah. It&#8217;s okay, I guess.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Okay? It&#8217;s magnificent.</p>
<p>Leonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?</p>
<p>Stuart: Oh, it&#8217;s hard to put a price on something that&#8217;s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let&#8217;s say 250?</p>
<p>Leonard: Oh, that&#8217;s pretty steep.</p>
<p>Stuart: Well, it&#8217;s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Only 8,000? We&#8217;re wasting precious time. Buy it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?</p>
<p>Stuart: Are you kidding? I&#8217;m already giving you the friends and family discount.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We&#8217;re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Slow down. Two hundred.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.</p>
<p>Leonard: Will you shut up?</p>
<p>Stuart: Tell you what, I&#8217;ll go two thirty-five.</p>
<p>Leonard: Nope. Maybe another time.</p>
<p>Stuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Take it, take it.</p>
<p>Leonard: Two hundred.</p>
<p>Stuart: Man, you&#8217;re killing me!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Killing you? I can&#8217;t breathe.</p>
<p>Stuart: Two ten, and I&#8217;m losing money.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, now, we can&#8217;t let him lose money, Leonard. I&#8217;m so sorry.</p>
<p>Leonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.</p>
<p>Stuart: Are you crazy? That helmet&#8217;s signed by Robert Downey Jr.</p>
<p>Leonard: So?</p>
<p>Stuart: Okay, if you&#8217;re going to question the importance of an actor&#8217;s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!</p>
<p>Leonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.</p>
<p>Stuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.</p>
<p>Leonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I&#8217;ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.</p>
<p>Stuart: You want me to wrap it?</p>
<p>Leonard: No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m gonna stab my friend in the chest.</p>
<p>Wil Wheaton <em>(entering)</em>: Hey, Stuart.</p>
<p>Stuart: Ah, hey, Wil.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.</p>
<p>Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.</p>
<p>Sheldon: It&#8217;s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?</p>
<p>Wil: No.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I&#8217;m not surprised.</p>
<p>Stuart: Here&#8217;s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.</p>
<p>Wil: Awesome. What do I owe you?</p>
<p>Stuart: Forty bucks.</p>
<p>Wil: Good deal.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Sucker. Didn&#8217;t even ask for the friends and family discount.</p>
<p>Wil: Hey, I&#8217;m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.</p>
<p>Stuart: Will there be girls there?</p>
<p>Wil: Yeah, of course.</p>
<p>Stuart: &#8216;Cause there wasn&#8217;t last time.</p>
<p>Wil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.</p>
<p>Leonard: Thank you.</p>
<p>Wil: All right, great. Later.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I see what you&#8217;re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we&#8217;re going to be there, and when we don&#8217;t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.</p>
<p>Leonard: I was actually thinking about going.</p>
<p>Sheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.</p>
<p>Stuart: Oh, great, more guys. It&#8217;s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.</p>
<p><em>Credits sequence.</em></p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Possibly.</p>
<p>Leonard: Can you or can&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: It&#8217;s not that simple, Leonard.</p>
<p>Leonard: It never is, is it?</p>
<p>Sheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton&#8217;s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I&#8217;m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger&#8217;s Friendship.</p>
<p>Leonard: Got it. Can I have my water?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.</p>
<p>Penny: Wait, what is going on?</p>
<p>Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger&#8217;s cat is a thought experiment&#8230;</p>
<p>Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn&#8217;t forget. Um, there&#8217;s this cat in a box and until you open it, it&#8217;s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother&#8217;s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.</p>
<p>Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You&#8217;re the whole package, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Howard <em>(arriving)</em>: Sorry I&#8217;m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team&#8217;s design for the deep field space telescope that&#8217;s going on the International Space Station this spring.</p>
<p>All: Wow.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Howie, that&#8217;s wonderful! Congratulations!</p>
<p>Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Mohammed Lee.</p>
<p>Howard: Who&#8217;s Mohammed Lee?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn&#8217;t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.</p>
<p>Howard: It&#8217;s me, Sheldon. It&#8217;s me. I&#8217;m going up in space! Technically, I&#8217;m an astronaut.</p>
<p>All: Wow, that&#8217;s amazing!</p>
<p>Bernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn&#8217;t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, well, it&#8217;s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?</p>
<p>Howard: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard&#8217;s making that a reality. We&#8217;re all very proud of you.</p>
<p>All: Cheers.</p>
<p>Sheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.</p>
<p>Leonard: Thank you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clich<span style="font-family:Calibri,sans-serif;">é</span>s. You sicken me.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Bernadette&#8217;s car.</em></p>
<p>Howard: You&#8217;re really quiet. Is everything okay?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.</p>
<p>Howard: I hope not too tired, because I&#8217;m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I always catch your drift.</p>
<p>Howard: All right, well, something&#8217;s obviously bugging you. What is it?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I just can&#8217;t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.</p>
<p>Howard: Oh, I get it. You&#8217;re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there&#8217;s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.</p>
<p>Howard: This isn&#8217;t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.</p>
<p>Bernadette: What did you think was going to happen?</p>
<p>Howard: Honestly? Sex.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Howard.</p>
<p>Howard: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We&#8217;re supposed to be partners. We&#8217;re supposed to be a team.</p>
<p>Howard: I&#8217;m sorry. You&#8217;re right. Okay, let&#8217;s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I&#8217;d like to discuss it.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Okay.</p>
<p>Howard: I&#8217;ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, we&#8217;re a team. So, what do you think?</p>
<p>Bernadette: No.</p>
<p>Howard: No?</p>
<p>Bernadette: No.</p>
<p>Howard: Well why not?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don&#8217;t want to live that way with you.</p>
<p>Howard: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you&#8217;re not going to space!</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Don&#8217;t talk to me as if nothing&#8217;s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.</p>
<p>Leonard: For God&#8217;s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?</p>
<p>Leonard: You never stop talking, do you?</p>
<p>Amy: I don&#8217;t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton&#8217;s party?</p>
<p>Penny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon&#8217;s mortal enemy.</p>
<p>Amy: Mortal enemy?</p>
<p>Penny: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Amy: Sheldon, I know you&#8217;re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?</p>
<p>Sheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?</p>
<p>Penny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.</p>
<p>Sheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This&#8217;ll just take a moment. It&#8217;s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.</p>
<p>Amy: A floppy disk?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.</p>
<p>Amy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?</p>
<p>All: Oh! Oh, God!</p>
<p>Sheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton&#8217;s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Howard&#8217;s bedroom.</em></p>
<p>Bernadette: Howard?</p>
<p>Howard: Change your mind about sex? I&#8217;m still mad, but I&#8217;ll do it.</p>
<p>Bernadette: No, I&#8217;ve just been thinking. It doesn&#8217;t matter if I&#8217;m afraid for your safety. I don&#8217;t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.</p>
<p>Howard: Really?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.</p>
<p>Howard: Thank you.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I love you.</p>
<p>Howard: I love you, too. So, sex now?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I&#8217;ll be right back. <em>(Exits)</em></p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz <em>(off)</em>: Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!</p>
<p>Bernadette: I&#8217;m ready.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The cafeteria.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?</p>
<p>Howard: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.</p>
<p>Raj: Wow. You&#8217;re not only our first astronaut. You&#8217;re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You&#8217;re like a rock star.</p>
<p>Howard: Little bit.</p>
<p>Leonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.</p>
<p>Leonard: Going to Wheaton&#8217;s party is not betraying you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it&#8217;s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m going to a party. I&#8217;m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!</p>
<p>Sheldon: Not yet.</p>
<p>Raj: So, what&#8217;s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?</p>
<p>Howard: I don&#8217;t know. If we&#8217;re going to get back together, she&#8217;s going to have to apologize and accept that I&#8217;m a grown man who can make his own decisions.</p>
<p>Raj: Then she&#8217;s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.</p>
<p>Howard: Obviously.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Penny&#8217;s apartment.</em></p>
<p>Bernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can&#8217;t go to space. He&#8217;s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?</p>
<p>Amy: You&#8217;re kidding.</p>
<p>Penny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do. I don&#8217;t want to break up over this.</p>
<p>Penny: Okay, why don&#8217;t you just tell him you made a mistake?</p>
<p>Bernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?</p>
<p>Amy: It&#8217;s not for us to judge. We&#8217;re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Oh, God, you&#8217;re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.</p>
<p>Penny: Well, that, that&#8217;s good. I&#8217;m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.</p>
<p>Bernadette: What?</p>
<p>Penny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?</p>
<p>Bernadette: I do, with all my heart.</p>
<p>Penny: Got it. Just had to check.</p>
<p>Amy: He&#8217;s great.</p>
<p><em>Scene: The apartment.</em></p>
<p>Leonard: All right, Sheldon, we&#8217;re going to Wil&#8217;s. This is your last chance.</p>
<p>Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you&#8217;re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.</p>
<p>Leonard: You want to drive?</p>
<p>Raj: Sure.</p>
<p>Leonard: Hey, Sheldon?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.</p>
<p>Leonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Brent Spiner?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yes.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I don&#8217;t care.</p>
<p>Leonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.</p>
<p>Sheldon: I did, but I think I&#8217;ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.</p>
<p>Leonard: I&#8217;m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.</p>
<p><em>Scene: Howard&#8217;s bedroom.</em></p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz <em>(off)</em>: Howard, Bernadette&#8217;s here!</p>
<p>Howard: Tell her I&#8217;m not home!</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz <em>(off)</em>: What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!</p>
<p>Bernadette: Can we talk?</p>
<p>Howard: You can. I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Bernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I&#8217;m sorry I said something to your mother.</p>
<p>Howard: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I know. I&#8217;m sorry. I got scared.</p>
<p>Howard: If you&#8217;re gonna love me, you&#8217;re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I know.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, don&#8217;t say it if you&#8217;re not gonna mean it, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>Bernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Howard: Well, those big kids were rocking it.</p>
<p>Bernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.</p>
<p>Howard: Really?</p>
<p>Bernadette: You&#8217;re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.</p>
<p>Howard: Right, right.</p>
<p>Mrs Wolowitz <em>(off)</em>: Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!</p>
<p><em>Scene: Wil Wheaton&#8217;s party.</em></p>
<p>Raj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?</p>
<p>Leonard: Yeah.</p>
<p>Raj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!</p>
<p>Leonard: What are you doing here?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you&#8217;re still my little buddy. I&#8217;m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let&#8217;s meet Brent Spiner and go home.</p>
<p>Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I&#8217;m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.</p>
<p>Sheldon: What I&#8217;d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.</p>
<p>Wil: This is for you.</p>
<p>Sheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.</p>
<p>Wil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn&#8217;t show up.</p>
<p>Wil: Look at what I wrote.</p>
<p>Sheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.</p>
<p>Wil: It&#8217;s my last one. I want you to have it.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!</p>
<p>Brent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven&#8217;t seen one of these in years. <em>(Rips open action figure packaging) </em>Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?</p>
<p>Sheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.</p>
<p>Brent: Sorry, Slim. I&#8217;ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?</p>
<p>Sheldon: You&#8217;ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.</p>
<p>Wil: Don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t take up a whole lot of your time.</p>
<p>Sheldon: Come on, buddy. Let&#8217;s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.</p>
<p>Leonard: Can we get autographed dolls?</p>
<p>Brent: Sure. Twenty bucks.</p>
<p>Leonard: Ten.</p>
<p>Brent: Eighteen.</p>
<p>Leonard: Twelve.</p>
<p>Brent: Sixteen.</p>
<p>Leonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.</p>
<p>Brent: Done.</p>
